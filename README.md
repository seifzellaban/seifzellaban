I've been rocking the software engineering student life for 3 years, and during that time, I took charge as a team leader at The Grand Masons. I've gained a solid rep for making teams thrive, coming up with killer strategies, and setting up smart policies. I'm a top-notch communicator, a team player through and through. Juggling multiple projects and smashing organizational goals is my jam, all while keeping things super organized.
